You can find the Linearicons font in four different formats under the "fonts" folder. You can use this font in desktop applications by installing the TTF font.

Open "Reference.html" to see a list of the icons available in the Linearicons font. The text box located to the bottom right of each icon contains a character (which may be invisible). You can copy and use this character in any desktop application that allows entering text and choosing a custom font to display it. You may also type or copy the text in the "liga" field if the environment in which you're using the font supports ligatures.

To get crisp results, use font sizes that are a multiple of 20px.

You can use this font in web too. But it is recommended to make a custom and optimized font, containing only the glyphs that you need. You can do so using the IcoMoon app (http://icomoon.io/app).

You can import "selection.json" to the IcoMoon app to modify this font.
